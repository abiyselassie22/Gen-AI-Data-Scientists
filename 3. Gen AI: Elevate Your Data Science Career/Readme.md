# Generative AI: Elevate Your Data Science Career

## Summary
This course addresses real-world Data science problems that Data Scientists face across multiple industries with data generation, data preparation, data querying, data augmentation, and feature engineering, and then shows how they effectively leverage Generative AI to tackle these challenges. It teaches how to use Generative AI to speed up data visualizations, build models and produce insights. It explains the industry-specific considerations while using Generative AI & the challenges data scientists face. It also discusses key ethics considerations around Generative AI & data, key concerns for executives across industries. It enables us to demonstrate our new Generative AI skills in hands-on labs of data preparation, data augmentation, data modeling & feature engineering projects that can be applied in real-life professions. In the Final Guided Project, I took on the role of a Data scientist for a consultancy firm with a major task to clean a few duplicate entries & few missing values from a car dataset and then perform EDA to draw keen insights into the data & determine the effect of different features of the car on the price. Specific tasks assigned to the role were to compare the models with linear, polynomial and ridge regressions on single and multiple variables to find the best performing model.
