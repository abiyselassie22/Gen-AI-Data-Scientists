# Generative AI: Prompt Engineering Basics

## Summary
This course defines prompt engineering and explains the concept and relevance of prompt engineering in Generative AI. It teaches the techniques, approaches and best practices for writing effective prompts. It enables everyone to leverage effective prompt engineering techniques to unlock the full potential of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT. It explores prompt techniques like zero-shot & few-shot, which are useful for improving the reliability & quality of large language models (LLMs). It also explores various prompt engineering approaches like Interview Pattern, Chain-of-Thought & Tree-of Thought, which are important at generating precise & relevant responses. It introduces one to commonly used prompt engineering tools like IBM watsonx Prompt Lab, Spellbook & Dust. It provides several hands-on labs & a Final Project that offer an opportunity to optimize results by creating effective prompts in the IBM Generative AI Classroom.
